### Declarative vs. imperative knowledge
- Declarative knowledge states facts.
- Imperative knowledge states how to accomplish something.

### Algorithm
An *algorithm* is how to perform a computation that contains *instructions* and *a flow of control* (the order in which we execute them) and a *termination condition* (when to stop). When it has halted, it has *converged*.

### Fixed vs. stored program computers
*Fixed program computers* were designed to do very specific tasks (e.g., the trajectory for an artillery shell). *Stored program computers* were designed to handle instructions like data (therefore programs could be easily modified, programs could produce programs).

### Interpreter
An *interpreter* executes any legal set of instructions. A *programming language* provides the controlled structures that can be used. A programming language has:

1. *syntax* — which sequences of characters and symbols constitute a well-formed string
2. *static semantics* — which well-formed strings have meaning
3. *semantics* — the meaning only has one meaning

### Program failures

1. crash — stops executing prior to completion
2. never stop — infinite loop
3. run to completion and produce wrong answer

### Interpreted vs. compiled languages

- interpreted languages — source code, checker, interpreter, output
- compiled languages — source code, checker/compiler, object code, interpreter, output

Interpreted languages are easier to debug because it reveals the source code, as opposed to the object code.
