### IDE
Integrated development environments provide a text editor, shell (environment for interpretation) with syntax highlighting, and integrated debugger.

### Objects
Every object has a type that can tell which properties it has. The programming language has `type` command for determing type.

- scalar type — single value
- non-scalar type — multiple value

An *expression* is a sequence of operands (i.e., objects) and operators (e.g., `3+5`). A variable is a named object; assigment binds name to object. A conditional is a test switch.

### Program types
A *straight line program* is a sequence of commands (e.g., no loops); every command gets executed once. A *branching program* differs by using conditionals.

Complex programs' execution times are proportional to input, not size of program due to *looping constructs*.
