### Computer scientists
Computer scientists work in many different industries. They think computationally, a fundamental skill of the coming century.

#### Computational thinking process
1. Identify or invent useful abstractions
2. Formulate solution to a problem as a computational experiment
3. Design and construct a sufficiently efficient implementation of the experiment
4. Validate experiment (i.e., debug it)5
5.  Run experiment
6. Evaluate results of the experiment
7. Repeat as needed

#### Computational thinking components
- **Abstraction**
	- Choosing the right abstraction
	- Operating in terms of multiple layers of abstraction simultaneously
	- Defining the the relationships between layers
- **Automation**
	- Think in terms of mechanizing our abstractions
	- Mechanization is possible
		- Because we have precise and exacting notations and models
		- There is some "machine" that can interpret our notations

 #### Computational thinking examples
 
 - How difficult is this problem and how best can I solve it?
 - How can we think recursively? (Reformulating complex problems into a previously-solved problem via reduction, embedding, transformation, or simulation.)

#### Computational thinking goals
- Machine learning, data mining
- Signal processing
- Algorithm design
- Software systems

#### Computational thinking random examples
- Improving outcomes of premature babies
- Reduce healthcare-associated infections
- Extracting information from physiological signals
	- Warning seizure patients before seizure hits
		- Difficulty: Onset, EEGs differ from patient to patient, requires patient-specific device
	- Predicting heart attacks
		- 15-20% of those with Acute Coronary Syndrome will die within 4 years
			- Gave some ICDs ($50k), but they were not surviving more than control group, due to infections, etc. and isn't necessary in 90% of patients (Can we predict who will benefit?)
			- "All happy hearts are alike; unhappy hearts are unhappy in their own way."
			- Split potentially predictive characteristics into groups, clustered their outcomes
