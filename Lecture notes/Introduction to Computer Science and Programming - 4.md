### Non-termination
You can use print statements to gain understanding.

### Functions
Functions provide *decomposition* and *abstraction*. Decomposition creates structure as in a module that is self-contained and resuable. Abstraction suppresses detail (only need to understand what it does, not how it does it).

Functions have names, parameters, and bodies. Functions are *invoked* (used). Functions have scope (the mapping of names to objects), and are contained in a stack that determines which values are references. On exiting an invocation, the stack is removed, freeing memory.
